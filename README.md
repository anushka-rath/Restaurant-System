# Restaurant-System
This is a Restaurant System where  I have created classes in C# inside a Console App. 

 

Class Hierarchy is displayed in the RestaurantEmployees abstract class which has been inherited by child classes Chef, Waiter and Receptionist according to roles. (Inheritance and Abstraction) 

 

Their methods has been defined inside Roles(). These classes can be modified as and when required since it is a Protected method declared as virtual, which means it can be overriden by child classes. (Polymorphism and Encapsulation ). 

 

The MenuDetails.cs file has an interface IMenuDetails which has been implemented by classes FoodItem and Beverages.  (Interfacing). 

Each class has it's own constructor with appropriate parameters. 

 

Finally, Object Instantiation has been achieved in the Program.cs file.
